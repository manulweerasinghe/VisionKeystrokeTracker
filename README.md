# Vision Keystroke Tracker + Overlay

This project original goal was to help me type faster with having a overlay on my screen, So i don't have to look down while I'm typing.

I manage to get the core concept work but coding convention are all over the place. That because of my novice in programming.
I am thinking to revisit this project in future and re-write whole thing from scratch because if I change something it will probably take lot of time to debug(without AI of cause), for now this is it.😊

I still learning and one of my goal is that, have knowledge to be able to write code without AI.
Unfortunately, I had to use AI (chatGPT) for `numpy` arrays and figure out windows directShow.

(Note: Use python 3.10 version, mediapipe is only supported upto that version.)
